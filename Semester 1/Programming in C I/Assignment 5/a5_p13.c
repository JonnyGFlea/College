/* BONUS

Write two functions:
  void uppcase(char *str)
    that replaces lowercase characters by uppercase
    characters and all other characters are not changed

  void lowcase(char *str)
    that replaces uppercase characters by lowercase characters
    and all other characters are not changed.

Use the functions isupper() and islower() which are in ctype.h.

Use the man page to see how these functions work.

Write a program to test the two functions. The program should repeatedly read a string (up to 90
chars) until you enter “exit” for the string. For every string the conversions after calling each
of the two functions should be printed on the screen.
