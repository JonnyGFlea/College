/*
Write a function
  int count lower(char* str)
  that counts the number of lowercase characters within in a string.

Then write a program where you
  repeatedly read a string
  and determine and print
    the number of lowercase characters in that string.

If you provide an empty string (the string will just contain ’\n’)
  then the program should stop its execution.

You must use a pointer to walk through the string.
You can assume that the string will be not longer than 50 characters and will be valid.
